----

**What does "Persisting Data" mean?**
**What is a Cookie?**
**Where are cookies stored?**
**When do cookies expire?**
**What should you NOT store in a cookie?**
**How can you view the cookies for a particular website?**
**How can you modify or delete those cookies?**

**How do you tell Rails to create a cookie?**
**What is the default cookie expiration date for cookies placed by the Rails cookies hash?**
**How is session similar to cookies?**
**When would you use session instead of cookies?**
**Why does this represent good engineering?**

Introduction to Databases
----

**What is the high level function of a Database?**
**Why is persisting data so important?**
**What (basically) is a Relational Database?**
**What is "CRUD"?**
**What is an ORM and why is it useful?**
**What is Rails' ORM?**

Introduction to Models
----

**What is the high level function of Models?**
**What does a model represent?**
**How do you instantiate a model?**
**How do you actually save it to the database?**
**How can you add attributes to a model manually?**
**What basic steps does ActiveRecord do when you ask it to save a model instance to the database?**
**How do you find a model instance based on its ID?
How do you delete a model instance?**

Introduction to Migrations
----

**What are Migrations?**
A script that tells Rails how to setup or change a db

**Why are Migrations helpful?**
Its an easy way to update a db table with plain Ruby code basically 

**What are the two ways to create migrations from the command line?**
Can use the following type of way.  Can also use the following way.

```ruby
$ rails generate model Post
```
OR

```ruby
$ rails generate migration AddSubtitleToPosts
```


**What does the timestamps method do?**
Timestamps in filename keep the migrations in an order, which is important and guarentees a unique name. 
Timestamps in migrate file add the following and are best practices working with dbs:

```ruby
created_at
```

```ruby
updated_at
```

**How do you run a migration?**

```ruby
rake db:migrate
```
Just tell the db what you want in the migration file then run the command above.

**How (and why) might you roll back a migration?**
To run roll back just run the following code:

```ruby
db:rollback
```

Say you messed up, don't need the column of information. Anytime you need to update the migration file to include or exclude something.

**What does it mean that most database operations are "reversible"?**
Since migrations are sequencial, we can roll back a migration(s). 

Note: When running 

```ruby
db:migrate
```
will run all migrations that haven't been run in the order of oldest timestamp to newest.

**What types of operations might not be reversible?**
Removing columns without a migration will be un-rollbackable...

Working with POROs
----

**What are POROs?**
**P**lain **O**ld **R**uby **O**bjects!!!

**Why might you use a PORO as a Model?**
Use to get fnctnllty from model that's doing too many things (no Singel responsibility principle). Or pull out logic out of a View

**What are software design patterns?**
Recipes for setting up classes to solve common problems.

**Where would you store POROs acting as models?**
If the PORO acst like a model, put it in the app/models folder.


**Where might you store POROs having other functionality?**
 If it's just a bunch of generic functions throw it in the lib foler

What Deployment is All About
----


**What is Deployment?**
Actually putting something out there for people to access.

**What is Systems Administration?**
Sys admin is getting the servers correctly configured and making sure a deployment doesn't break.

**What other names do SysAdmins typically go by in a web dev organization?**
Dev Ops

**What does a SysAdmin typically do?**

* *Build servers*
+ Install applications
+ Maintain the systems running these applications
* Monitor the systems and applications

**How does Cloud Computing work for servers?**
You buy space of a running computer, then use that to deploy your app. Still have to set it up.

**What high level steps are required to do a typical deployment?**

* Set up the server's system from scratch or to mirror some existing system setup (e.g. make sure the operating system, server software, and Ruby are installed)
* Set up the file structure and permissions on the OS so the application(s) can run
* Provision and enable connections to a new or existing database
* Acquire your web application's code base (e.g. from Git)
Update libraries and download any dependencies
* Supply any environment variables (e.g. secret keys, passwords, private configuration information) required to make your application run and actually connect to the database
* Turn on your server and start up the application
* Monitor status, traffic, errors, logs etc...


**What's the difference between a "Web Server" and an "Application Server"?**
Web server is used to collect all the incoming requrests and give them to the app server when it is ready to (is done with current operation).

Web servers allow load balancing.

**What are the two "entry points" for a request in a typical architecture?**

- Web server
- Prox server

**What is a "Reverse Proxy" web server and why is it needed?**
Is what services the http requests and passes them along to the app server as it has availability

**What is the "Application Server"?**
Is the server that runs the application code. The brains of the operation.

**What is the default server used by Rails?**
WEBrick, but can use many others

**Why should you probably use a different one in Production?**
Because you'll likely need something that supports reverse proxy servers on the front end so you can balance the load.

**What is an application "Cluster"?**
Is a network of servers all running the same application. Revese proxy servers balance the load by distributing the load between them all.

**Why is a "staging server" often used?**
So you can get bugs worked out in a testing environment instead of people facing environment.

**What is "Continuous Integration (CI)"?**
Where developers push changes to the production environment. Is made possible by automated testing and having thoroughly vetted code!

**What is Capistrano and why is it helpful?**
Capistrano is a remote server automation tool.  Helps automate tasks associated with deployment.

Introduction to Heroku
----

**What is Heroku?**
Is a cloud hosting service built on top of EC2(aws).  Takes care of all the setup and provisioning efforts including DB, reverse proxies, load balancing, and application servers.
**What is a "Dyno"?**
A dyno is an instance of your running application.
**What are "Add-ons" and why are they helpful?**
Viewing current addons:

```ruby
$ heroku addons
# add new addon
$ heroku addons:add newrelic:standard
```
Addons are like the ruby gems of the heroku environment.

**Which database does Heroku use?**
Postgres

Deploying Your Apps to Heroku
----

**How do you run your local server on a different port?**
Use the -p flag as follows:

```ruby
$ rails server -p 3001
```
runs on port 3001.

**How do you run your Production environment locally?**
Use the -e (environment) flag as follows:

```ruby
$ rails s -e production
```

**How do you create a new Heroku app?**
Make sure to add gems heroku need to the production group

```ruby
group :production do
	gem 'rails_12factor' #for heroku issues with rails 4
	gem 'pg' #for postgres support
end
```
Then run the following to initiate a heroku remote.

```ruby
$ heroku create
```
Then edit the **config/database.yml** file to reflect the following:

```yaml
production:
	adapter: postgresql
```

**What Git remote does that create for you?**
heroku remote is created and used

**How do you push to Heroku?**

```ruby
$ git push heroku master
    ...
    building app
    ...
    app successfully built!
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```

**How do you run your database migrations on Heroku?**

```ruby
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```

**How to you open your app to view it?**

```ruby
$ heroku open
```

**Heroku commands**

```ruby
# Create a Heroku app
$ heroku create

# Deploy your app
$ git push heroku master

# Restart your app
$ heroku restart

# Open your Heroku app
$ heroku open

# Add services to your app
$ heroku addons:add some_addon:some_tier

# View configured addons
$ heroku addons

# Toolbelt commands
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
$ heroku run console

# Tailing logs
$ heroku logs -t

# Set a config var on Heroku
$ heroku config:set YOUR_VARIABLE=some_value

```

Debugging Deployments
----
[Heroku guide on diagnosing errors](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/error-pages)

**What are the two places you'll likely encounter the most errors when deploying to heroku?**

* Some have to do with improperly setting up the heroku environment
* Forgetting to install gems
   * Have to make sure you identify environments for each gem
* Asset pipeline another source of issues
   * Usually solved by altering config files
 

**How can you upload config/environment variables to Heroku?**

1. Use gem figaro to manage env vars
2. Use the hard setting way with heroku CLI

```ruby
$ heroku config:set YOUR_VARIABLE=some_value
```

**CODE REVIEW**

```ruby
# Tailing logs
$ heroku logs -t

# Set a config var on Heroku
$ heroku config:set YOUR_VARIABLE=some_value
```
